David,

I really appreciate your email and sharing such sensitive and private information about your family. I sincerely hope that I haven't given the impression of judgement on my side and if I have, please accept my heartfelt apology. I can deeply feel the love you and Yaffa have for Zev and I cannot imagine what trials and tribulations you as parents have experienced and risen above. I know Yaffa is a strong woman and has only had good intent and is a great parent. I do agree that Zev's anger is VERY misplaced and is devastating that Yaffa is suffering from the emotional pain this has caused. 

I want you to know that I have a lot of respect for Yaffa, and cannot imagine what it's like for her to experience such unwarranted and misplaced animosity from her own child. 

I  look forward to us speaking today and again appreciate you reaching out to me and providing added perspective and information about your family history. 

Warmly,
Phyllis

Resending from another email address.
Dear Phyllis,
I am reaching out to you today with a deeply personal matter, and I would appreciate your utmost discretion. The fact that Zev blames and feels so much resentment toward his mother is painful to us. My wife is the compassionate, selfless and self-aware person I know, and she feels utterly devastated by Zev's unjust resentful feelings towards her.
 
It’s important that you have this context, let me share a bit of our family history. When our daughter Aliza was diagnosed with cancer at just eight months old, Yaffa devoted her life to her recovery and rehabilitation. Aliza's battle with cancer left her with physical disabilities, yet, through Yaffa's relentless and hard work and sacrifices, she was able to overcome her challenges. Today, Aliza is happily married, an accomplishment that would not have been possible without Yaffa's tireless love, dedication and perseverance to advocate and our daughter’s behalf and give her the best care possible.
 
For over 20 years, our lives, particularly Yaffa's, have been marked by a great deal of stress and strain. When Zev exhibited severe symptoms of OCD, it was Yaffa who stood by him and guided him through the process. However, it seems that her unwavering involvement was misconstrued by Zev. Her insistence on medication adherence and refusal to enable his dangerous behavior, such as drugs usage, staying out all night led him to harbor resentment and anger towards her.
 
Let me be clear: nobody is perfect. We all have habits and insecurities that may irritate others. Yet, Zev seems unable to look beyond these minor flaws, opting instead to demonize his mother to justify his own anger. His misplaced resentment is a testament to his own struggles with forming and maintaining relationships, not a reflection of Yaffa's character.
 
In conclusion, I want to reiterate that Yaffa is among the most selfless, compassionate, and introspective individuals I know. It is disheartening that Zev's anger, which is unfounded and misplaced, is causing her such emotional pain. 
 
Yours sincerely,
David
